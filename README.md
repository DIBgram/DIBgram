DIBgram: An unofficial Telegram app which looks like Telegram Desktop, but is implemented in web technologies.

## Usage

You can open the stable release of DIBgram at <https://DIBgram.github.io>, or the commitly(?) build at <https://DIBgram.github.io/beta>.

You can also build DIBgram yourself, as described [here](BUILDING.md).

## Why make it

Many people like the official Telegram Desktop. But there are users who prefer to use Telegram on their browsers because of either security, work conditions or something else.

Also, most web versions either look bad or have missing features ([Webk][] and [Webz][] are better though)

[Webk]: https://webk.telegram.org
[Webz]: https://webz.telegram.org

I am developing this app so there is a web version that not only has most features and looks good, but also looks familiar to those who use Telegram Desktop.

## Technologies, libraries and other software used in this project
