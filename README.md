DIBgram: An unofficial Telegram app which looks like Telegram Desktop, but is implemented in web technologies.

## Why make it

Many people like the official Telegram Desktop. But not all desktop users have Windows, MacOS or Linux, or they don't want to install anything on their device.  
So I am developing this app so these users can have the same experience as Telegram Desktop using their browsers.

## Technologies, libraries and other software used in this project

- **HTML, JS, CSS**: The languages of the web
- **TdLib**: Telegram Database Library. Takes care of networking, encryption and storage
- **React**: UI framework used in project
- **Babel**: Compiler of the source code
- **Sass**: CSS preprocessor
- **ESLint**: Used to detect problems, warnings and enforce code style
- **VSCode**: The IDE (or code editor) I use to develop the app. Also recommended for contributors

## Contributing

- Contributions should follow these rules:
  - There should be no ESLint errors, warnings or notices
  - It should compile and run successfully
  - It should not introduce a feature that is not present in the official Telegram Desktop app
  - Behavior and UI should be similar to the official Telegram Desktop app
- Bug reports and feature requests are welcome, but do not ask for features not present in the official Telegram Desktop app.
