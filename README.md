DIBgram: An unofficial Telegram app which looks like Telegram Desktop, but is implemented in web technologies.

## Why make it

Many people like the official Telegram Desktop. But not all desktop users have Windows, MacOS or Linux, or they don't want to install anything on their device.  
So I am developing this app so these users can have the same experience as Telegram Desktop using their browsers.

## Technologies, libraries and other software used in this project

- **Telegram Desktop**: The basis of the design and look of DIBgram
- **HTML, JS, CSS**: The languages of the web
- **TdLib**: Telegram Database Library. Takes care of networking, encryption and storage
- **React**: UI framework used in project
- **Sass**: CSS preprocessor
- **ESLint**: Used to detect problems, warnings and enforce code style
- **VSCode**: The IDE (or code editor) I use to develop the app. Also recommended for contributors
