/*
    WebPack adds random numbers to the path of files,
     and modifies CSS paths to point to the changed path.
    However, there are file in which the path modification is
     not supported by WebPack (e.g. URL in JSON data).
    So the files are defined here so WebPack can add it to
     the bundled resources and change the path. Then we can
     access it with CSS variables.
